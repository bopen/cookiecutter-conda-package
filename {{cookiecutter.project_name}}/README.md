# {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}

{{ cookiecutter.project_short_description }}

## Quick Start

```python
>>> import {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}

```

## Workflow for developers/contributors

For best experience create a new conda environment (e.g. {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}_env) with Python 3.11:

```
conda create -n {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}_env -c conda-forge python=3.11
conda activate {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}_env
```

Before pushing to GitHub, run the following commands:

1. Update conda environment: `make conda-env-update`
1. Install this package in editable mode: `pip install -e .`
1. (optional) Sync with the latest [template](https://github.com/spark-cleantech/package-template) : `make template-update`
1. (optional) Run quality assurance checks (code linting): `make qa`
1. (optional) Run tests: `make unit-tests`
1. (optional) Run the static type checker: `make type-check`
1. (optional) Build the documentation (see [Sphinx tutorial](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/tutorial/)): `make docs-build`

If using Windows, `make` is not available by default. Either install it 
([for instance with Chocolatey](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32127524/how-to-install-and-use-make-in-windows)),
or open the [Makefile](./Makefile) and execute the lines therein manually.
